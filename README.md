SmartrapCore design recreated in Autodesk Inventor

This is based on the [smartcore] (https://github.com/smartfriendz/smartcore) design dated 25 July 2015. I just want to play with the design in Inventor and may build a custom version. No intention to keep this updated as the smartcore keep evolving.
